# NHL POC using VueJS

## Description
This is the initial rough proof-of-concept to test out chart.js with VueJS3. This example uses Bootstrap 5 and serves the following two static charts, data and color can be changed in the variables:
- Radar chart
- Doughnut chart

Neither the labels nor the represented data have any basis in reality.

## Install
```
npm install
```

## Run
```
npm run serve
```
Then open the localhost URL listed in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8080).

## Build
```
npm run build
```
Please note that if you upload this to a directory on a web server, you will need to set the publicPath in the vue.config.js to the directory's name.
